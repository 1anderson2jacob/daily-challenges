# Daily Challenges

## Synopsis
Welcome to my portfolio of daily coding challenges. The goal is to find a coding problem each day, write a quick suite of Jest tests, and then solve it as quickly as I can. On Fridays I choose one of my solutions for the week, and take time to make it more time and/or space efficient.
